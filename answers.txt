Answer the following questions using your implementation:

1. Is it significantly better to play as 'X', or 'O', or neither?

2. Describe an approach that will allow you to test if all first moves
   are equally good for 'X'. The method should be valid (yields
   correct results) and efficient (use minimal calculation).

3. Using the method described in (2), are all first moves for 'X'
   equally good?  If so, what are the odds that 'X' will win?  If not
   which is the best move for 'X' and how much does it improve the
   odds 'X' will win over the second best move?

3. If 'X' moves into the bottom middle square, what is O's best
   response? (i.e.  the response that is *least likely* to yield a win
   for X)?

4. As the board gets bigger, is X's first move more, or less,
   strategically important?
