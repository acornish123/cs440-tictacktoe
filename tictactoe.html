<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
<p>Tic-Tac-Toe is not the most sophisticated game, but it has the nice
property that the rules are simple, and the total number of game
states (3^9) can be enumerated easily. Further, each game has a finite
length.  In this assignment you'll build a simple Tic-Tac-Toe class to
assist with playing the game. Then we'll use the logic to make some
calculations about the environment.  A simple stub module has been
provided.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<ol>
<li>Download the stub <code>tictactoe.py</code> and open it in your favorite editor (emacs, right?!).</li>
<li>Look through the code.  I've written some functionality, and the goal is for you to complete it.</li>
<li>Note that there are 5 methods/functions that are unimplemented, these are where you should add your code.</li>
<li>Note further that the code assumes four spaces of indentation. Set your editor appropriately, this is the default for many.</li>
<li>The code contains a main method with some argument parsing ability.  You can get some details on usage with: <code>python tictactoe.py --help</code></li>
</ol>
<h1>Implement the methods</h1>
<p>Once the methods are implemented, you should be able to play the game
of tic-tac-toe by running on the command line as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;python tictactoe.py --play
</code></pre>
<p>My input/output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>   |   |
-----------
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
X's turn...(0..8)
0
 X |   |
-----------
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
O's turn...(0..8)
2

&lt;&lt;&lt; moves happen... &gt;&gt;&gt;

X |   | O
-----------
 X | X |
-----------
 O | O |
X's turn...(0..8)
8
 X |   | O
-----------
 X | X |
-----------
 O | O | X
Game Over!  X (1) wins @ Diagonal Upper Left
</code></pre>
<p>You should also be run a simulation like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;python cs440/tictactoe/src-python/tictactoe.py --state 121221210 --mc 10
State is: (1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 0)
10 trials: 1 wins 1.00, -1 wins 0.00, stalemates 0.00
</code></pre>
<p>Note that at the command line, you represent the state with {0,1,2}
not {0,1,-1}. Eventhough the moves above are selected "randomly", the
only remaining move makes 'X' win every time.</p>
<h1>Final Steps</h1>
<p>Now, use your code to answer the questions that are listed at the top
of the <code>tictactoe.py</code> file.  Write your answers inline in the
doc-string, and be sure your name appears at the top of the string.</p>
<h1>Turn in your code</h1>
<p>My hope is that you'll be able to submit your code via Autolab and it will give you some minor assurance that it's working reasonably.</p>
<p>https://autolab.encs.vancouver.wsu.edu</p>
<p>However, my use of Autolab in this course is rather new. 
If you find an issue, or run into problems let me know! If you find an
actual bug, I'll give you some extra credit.</p>
